                Tags: <b>Unity, GitHub, Dialogue System, Scriptable Objects, FMOD, Text Animator, Group Project</b><br>
                A 6 months project, in a team with other 7 people. This graphic adventure was shown at Milan Games Week in October 2024.
                In this game, I had the opportunity to learn a lot about code refactoring and optimization, and I was able to fill many gaps in my coding knowledge.
                Furthermore, this was the first time I worked with external tools, such as <b>Yarn Spinner</b> for the dialogue system and <b>Text Animator</b> for text effects.
